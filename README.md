# Credit_analysis
#### Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this assignment is to understand the unbalance classification problem that is in credit risk. Because home buying is one of the pillars of the economy. Prioritizing the lowest risk for defaulting can strengthen and prevent large financial disasters like the 2008 housing crisis.

#### Results: 
* The accuracy scores and precision indicated that while not all sensitivity is very high while the precision is very low. Making the algorithm a not very useful one. During the testing that it was clear that the F1 score was around 0.002 or low. Creates an imbalance between sensitivity and precision being that it has a low yield F1 score.

#### Summary: In Summary, there are multiple ways to conduct predictive analysis. Choosing the correct one should be carefully thought out, while the sample size affects the overall decision tree. Determining whether its classification or regression is the first step to achieving the best results.
